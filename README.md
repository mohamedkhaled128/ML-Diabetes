# Diabetes Prediction and Recommendation System

A machine learning–based system for predicting diabetes and providing personalized health recommendations using clinical and lifestyle data.  
Developed by Muhammed Khaled.

---

## 📖 Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease with serious long-term health implications. Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes and reduces healthcare costs.  
This project, developed by Muhammed Khaled, applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict diabetes and generate basic recommendations to support early intervention.

The system is trained and evaluated using the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset and implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The project utilizes the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for diabetes prediction tasks.

**Key features include:**

Age  
Body Mass Index (BMI)  
Blood glucose level  
Blood pressure  
HbA1c level  
Physical activity  
Daily calorie intake  
Smoking history  
Diabetes type  

Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed by Muhammed Khaled to handle missing values, remove inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for modeling.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

Three supervised learning models were implemented and evaluated in this project by Muhammed Khaled:

Random Forest Classifier  
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
Gradient Boosting Classifier  

The dataset was split into 67% training and 33% testing, with cross-validation applied to ensure model stability and generalization.

---

## 📊 Performance Evaluation

Model performance was assessed using standard classification metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Model | Accuracy**  
Random Forest Classifier | 97%  
Gradient Boosting Classifier | 88%  
Support Vector Classifier | 66%  

The Random Forest Classifier, implemented and tuned by Muhammed Khaled, achieved the highest accuracy and was selected as the final model.
